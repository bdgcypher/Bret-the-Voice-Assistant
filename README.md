# Bret-the-Voice-Assistant
A basic voice assistant coded in python. Bret uses google speech recognition and pyttsx3 to listen for and respond to commands. Bret can open websites, search the web, tell you the date and time, open directions in google maps, and even send emails for you.

This code uses PyAudio which can have some trouble installing. To install it correctly follow the instructions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52283840/i-cant-install-pyaudio-on-windows-how-to-solve-error-microsoft-visual-c-14 

I included the pyaudio wheel for python 3.9

if you are using a different version you will need to find the corrrect version for yourself at https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
